PFsense seems like a greatway to save money instead shelling out a lot for a router. It uses a pc, as long as it has two networks cards
it can be a powerful tool. And it is a great way to recycle computers. Of course if you are on a more professional level you should
most likely get an embedded device. But if your at home or in soma small town coffee shop grab that old pc out of storage and fire it up. It almost
seems like they would be better than a router because they are much more sophiosticated hardware wise. Also, they can be configured to be a firewall as well
which is what I think I am going to use my old notebook for.
