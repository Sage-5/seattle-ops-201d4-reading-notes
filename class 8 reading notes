The windows registry is a collection of databases that apply to all users which has its own user specific settings. It loads the files form memory for 
your configuration settings. It contains folders like 'keys, and 'values' and inside those are data. Its made up of multiple groups. Each group is called
a hive. It lets you customize windows individual settings for super users 'registry hacks'. Its nice if you know what you are doing but a word of caution 
you can mess up your operating system if not careful. Of the registry hacks in the lab were pretty fun just customizing little things.
