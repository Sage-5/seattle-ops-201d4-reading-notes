This repo is a collection of my reading notes from all the subjects we covered in 201. If your wondering why I am taking notes for this class
it is to enrich my future, become a better student, person, employee, and team mate.As well as to enrich those who I come in contact with and
 who I know on every level.Learning what I can from IT professionals and take away the most beneficial concepts to apply. Some of the more 
 fundatmentals concepts I learned while taking this class are basic computer operations you can do from the command line to check systems, networking
 concepts that show good security standards to apply, even things like working in a team environment. My favorite Ops challenge probably was the last
 one that searched for domain information because I understood how bash could be reusable for getting information you need.
     Shell scripting could be used to find almost anything you can from and gui interface but a little faster but not as cute as an gui interface. You
can run commands to find information, check files, and many operations which will help you to utilize secure messaging SFTP. I would improve my bash, shell scripts, and use git as well. I know the command line is boring as far as interface why it is a widely underestimated and extremely powerful tool. Shelll scripting
I would improve would be the use of functions, grep, and the pipeline.
