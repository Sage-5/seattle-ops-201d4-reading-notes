This article teaches how to methodically solve IT problems. Its like history, you dont have to recreate the wheel each time you encounter a problem. The big take away 
for me is to get organized an keep track of notes, documents, lecture, in a fashion that you can reference it effieciently otherwise your looking for
a needle in an disorganized situation and cant solve it quickly. I have learned this from this class to start organizing my work. And also to back it up.
Have a back up plan or steps that will still move you forward no matter how slowly.
