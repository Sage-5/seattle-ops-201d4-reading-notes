Malware is an evasive way for nefarouis characters to invade a computer. In some cases you will have to reboot in safe mode, stay off the internet as not to
spread it. Find the files remove them, do a disk cleanup and scan for malware for with something like malware bytes and then fix any damage it has done to
your browser if neccesary. Recover files if windows is corrupt and then cleam up. It would be a good time for a fresh installation of windows.


   The research dome by Google in the Aristotle project just shows how a healthy work envirionment affects teams. This is why some teams may outperform others
   though their skillsets are mismatched. Healthy things come out of good teams, which spawn creativity because your not thinking about who is going to 
   shoot down what you want to share or be overly critical of it. I know its not like a lot of new information was revealed to what in history was thought
   to work before technology and data crunches. I guess thats why you see an underdog outperform a "winning" team sometimes. I do think all the new data
   supports the fact that a safe working team or environment is affected by emotional intelligence.
