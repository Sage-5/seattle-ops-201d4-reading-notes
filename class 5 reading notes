The SMB protocol is a client-server protocol for sharing files, printers, serial ports and data on a network. Runs on NetBIOS  uses TCP port 139.
In 2000 Microsoft changed SMB 1.0 to port 445 it was slow and a blockk level. SMB 2.0 improved protocols efficiency by reducing commands from hundreds to 19.
SMB 3.0  improved even further and SMB 2.0 and more security was added and end to end encryption. SAMBA is an implemenatation of it created in 1992 and there are 
many others.

Some of the ways to stop security risks on these ports:
Avoid exposing SMB ports.
Patch everything.
Back up everything so there is no single point of failure.
Use a firewall.
Use a VPN. 
Implement and VLAN.
Use MAC Address filtering.
