Writing a good SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) is as important as making it something that points to its purpose. It seems it would contain a mission statement,
purpose, and procedures all wrapped into a neat package. The article mentions do not poorly write, over write, or make to consice. I think this is important
because if it does not keep and hold the person attention and help them to carry out what they need to do. If it was too vague or to detailed it would not
be something employees, members, or students will like to implement because they do not like it. Maybe it is too exhaustive or to vague. 

     The goal of an SOP is to provide overall guidance while staing what, when, why, and how that needs to be done. There is many ways of different work to accomplish
an SOP so you have to be flexible in stating it, but not leave it too vague that its not guiding anyone. You have guidance, you have a plan, you work the plan.
it should be: readable, consumable, understandable, actionable, and measurable. And ways to writing good ones are simple, portable, consistent, and uses
flowcharts (diagrams, etc.) to help the audience understand it.
